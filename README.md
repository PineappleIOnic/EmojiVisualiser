## What is EmojiVisualiser
EmojiVisualiser is a Audio Visualiser with emojis! It's built with React and uses AudioContext to achieve the visualisation. It is horrendously unoptimised and was mainly built as a overnight project to test the AudioContext API aswell as neumorphism UI and was inspired by a tweet from [Antoje](https://twitter.com/TTTUUUJJJ911117)

## Can I help?
I would urge you to not and help another open-source project that wasn't built as a joke but if you want to we accept PRs, Issues and Feature Requests from anyone! :)

## Getting Started
Start by cloning or forking the repository and running:
`yarn install` to install dependencies and `yarn start` to start the development server with live-reload on changes.
